# Hematometer
An open-source, highly sensitive hemoglobin detection system to quantify neural activity in real-time.

# Overview
Brain activity holds the key to some incredibly valuable information - ranging from health metrics, prosthetics, and even reverse-engineering our thoughts with surprisingly high precision. After all, our thoughts are formed through the collective firing patterns of the trillions of neurons cooperating. Currently; however, the main method of measuring brain activity is quite rudimentary, and has experienced minimal development over the past decades.
